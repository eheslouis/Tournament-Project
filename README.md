#Tournament Project

##Project Overview
You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

## How to run it
First, run vagrant.
Then using the psql command line interface, include the tournament.sql file. This will load the database as well as the tables for the project
Then run 'python tournament_test.py' to make sure that all the unit tests are passed.
